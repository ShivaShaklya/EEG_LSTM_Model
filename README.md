EEG based Confusion Detection<br>
An LSTM Model (Long-Short Term Memory) used for the prediction of confusion/no confusion through EEG signals. 
The model processes the data, converts the data into time-sequences of 10 readings each and identifies patterns in the same. 
The program allows us to save the trained model and standard scaler object and use the same for predictions for new data.<br>
