EEG-based Confusion Detection<br>
An LSTM Model (Long-Short Term Memory) used for the prediction of confusion/no confusion through EEG signals. 
The model processes the data, converts it into time-sequences of 10 readings each and identifies patterns for the same. 
The program allows us to save the trained model and the standardscaler object and use the same to make predictions for new upcoming data.<br>
